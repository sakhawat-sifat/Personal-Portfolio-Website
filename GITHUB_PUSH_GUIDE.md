# How to Push to GitHub Repository

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `Personal Portfolio Website`
5. Description: `Modern responsive portfolio website built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS`
6. Keep it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Personal-Portfolio-Website.git

# Rename main branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Alternative - Use these specific commands
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Personal-Portfolio-Website.git
git branch -M main  
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Verify Upload
- Go to your GitHub repository page
- You should see all your files
- Check that the README.md displays properly
